# BreakingDoses
Our project, “Breaking Doses”, aims to provide a web-based medication management platform that allows users
to easily schedule their medicines, receive reminders, track adherence, and visualise their progress. This ensures
better health outcomes by reducing missed doses and providing users with greater control over their treatment
routine.
